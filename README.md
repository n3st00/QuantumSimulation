This is a project in which I have tried to simulate elementary particles using the Coulomb's Law and Van der Wals(London forces) forces. 
The plan was to later on move to simulating even deeper levels, maybe even photons or electrons(wave particle duality).
My goal would be to create an interactive simulation that would be a playground. User could add different particles and see how they interact(not forgetting about the nerdy stuff like outputting the actual values and metrics).
I've been hoping I could create larger systems using the elementary particles or simulate and watch chemical reactions.

For the rendering part, I did not want to use any of the existing physical engines, because they usually do not really fit to such tasks with very low mass and sizes. Also, I was interested to try and create one myself.
I decided to dive into rendering and 3d graphics for this. 



The project was abandoned.
